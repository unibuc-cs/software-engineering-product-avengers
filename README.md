## Security Analysis

### Major Security Risks

#### Backend Risks

1. **SQL Injection**
   - Risk: Users could input malicious code in forms to gain unauthorized data access
   - Solution: 
     - Using EF ORM
     - Query parameterization to prevent SQL injection

2. **Authentication**
   - Risk: Improper authentication management could allow unauthorized access to sensitive resources
   - Solutions:
     - OAuth 2.0 implementation
     - JWT utilization
     - Prevention of session hijacking through HttpOnly, Secure, and SameSite cookie settings

3. **Sensitive Data Exposure**
   - Risk: Protection of passwords, API keys, and user information from data leaks
   - Solutions:
     - Password hashing using bcrypt
     - Proper configuration of appsettings.json to avoid hardcoding sensitive data

#### Frontend Risks

1. **Unsafe Dependencies**
   - Risk: Vulnerabilities in npm packages
   - Solutions:
     - Using npm audit for identification
     - Regular updates using npm update and npm audit fix

#### API Risks

1. **API Key Security**
   - Risk: Potential compromise of Google APIs and Amadeus API keys
   - Solutions:
     - Storing API keys in a Secrets Manager instead of source code
     - Restricting API key usage through IP whitelisting
